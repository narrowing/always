That perhaps there are many formulas to happiness that differ based on your perception to happiness. That for some of these equations richness and power is a factor. Or that the ability to make change and feel substantial is af actor. To feel your story was epic and romance was movie like. Are these formulas, or rather, perceptions, are? Or are they borrowed from movies and parents and friends? Is any perception not borrowed? No. No perception is pure just as the leaf's thoughts are the same as ours. But some perceptions are better for living within the environment you choose and the thoughts and mental model that are engrained deep inside of you. Some are healthier and bring more years of children who can better cope and this seems absolute. But there are so many factors and variations of any style of thinking or way to achieve an unclear perceived happiness that we cannot calculate or predict the very best way to live. To work only at that could yield enlightenment or it could yield regression, circular thought and insanity. WE do not take this risk as an enlightenment is an idea of happiness that is absolute but may just be a really good \"relative.\" We prefer to trod making occasional stabs at happiness. Thinking about it lightly our whole life but never dedicating ourselves to finding it. Why should we? Happiness is after all, an option for a goal of life and how can you define happiness is, again, an opinion.",

And with low and pain comes the beauty of happiness which is far more enjoyable to experience and so it seems there is a better and worse way to live because there is a maximization and minimization of pleasure and pain, making occurrences that are arbitrary seem better or worse for our life with the ultimate goal of perhaps experiencing ultimate pleasure without pain.",

Also, the fact that happiness is not just scalar in the sense of unhappy or happy but that happiness is a categorization in itself and all of the different components that form happiness almost make a circle and by adding all of the different elements they rise into a cone. Molly may seem like it should give you that element of happiness but because of the way we think and what we deem as beautiful, you need something that can hit those many different feelings you have and wants you have to create this truly beautiful scene that can bring true happiness. If you want to be in the best environment possible, walking on clouds may not be enough because there are other feelings that you want. Feeling finished, feeling sure, feeling unstoppable, feeling intrigued by everything. There is a gambit of emotion that matters to us, and that is why designing something so well is so difficult. Functional does not just mean it does a function. Part of its function is making it so you enjoy it, and enjoy your experience and your time while using it. To achieve this, it must make you feel many of these emotions that you want to feel. A desk chair should make you feel unstoppable, brilliant, creative, confident to pick up a phone. These are the things I want in my desk chair just as much or more as it can raise and lower me. This is why purchasing luxuries is not so bad (necessarily). It becomes religion. It creates an environment and a mindset of how you should feel and think, which creates what you believe. My interior design forms the way I see the world more than a prayer book might.",

Information reaches us through our sensors, our keyboard, mice, the rocks touching the heat, and our nervous system reacts and our brain learns and decides how it should react. Through machine learning, it knows what pixels to show and expressions to make and things to say. it is like a sea urchant that reacts when predators are near by even though it does not think. it is like dropping water on a straw wrapper and making it move. it is all a mechanical process at some level. Skin heats up, which changes pressure in a nerve, which is built to react a certain way, and by built I mean that the way the physics is set up is like an inanimate object reacting. When the pressure on the rock becomes too high, steam shoots upward. Our nervous system doing this is just as arbitrary, but for the billion times the nervous system was not build like this (like all of the rocks not shaped like spheres for us to use a s a wheel)l this system was without purpose even if we found purpose in it and it became useful.

That matters because that makes you unhappy again. Its not just work but life. And so its easy to accept the thing that allows you happiness in some areas instead of demanding it in all. This takes creativity and the ability to figure out what would make you happy if anything? Why is it that something must make you happy? Change your frame of mind to convince you something does.
