Certain perspectives will more likely yield happiness, cooperation, competition, misery, and innovation. The justification in spreading a way of thinking is to help others reach a healthier, longer living life. While there are better and worse ways of thinking on certain scales, the way the endpoint is defined is arbitrary based on what society deems as a success in that field. Health as measurable by life expectancy is easy to measure. Innovation could refer to technologically or to new ways of thinking or manipulating one's own body. A monk being able to raise their own body temperature is not technological but requires thought and focus far beyond that possible of an average laymen and training.",\

Molly may seem like it should give you that element of happiness but because of the way we think and what we deem as beautiful, you need something that can hit those many different feelings you have and wants you have to create this truly beautiful scene that can bring true happiness. If you want to be in the best environment possible, walking on clouds may not be enough because there are other feelings that you want. Feeling finished, feeling sure, feeling unstoppable, feeling intrigued by everything. There is a gambit of emotion that matters to us, and that is why designing something so well is so difficult. Functional does not just mean it does a function. Part of its function is making it so you enjoy it, and enjoy your experience and your time while using it. To achieve this, it must make you feel many of these emotions that you want to feel. A desk chair should make you feel unstoppable, brilliant, creative, confident to pick up a phone. These are the things I want in my desk chair just as much or more as it can raise and lower me. This is why purchasing luxuries is not so bad (necessarily). It becomes religion. It creates an environment and a mindset of how you should feel and think, which creates what you believe. My interior design forms the way I see the world more than a prayer book might.",\

Similarly, things you believe to bring you joy may get poor response from others. In the eyes of GOd, you have every right to do this action. Other men have every right to stop it.
