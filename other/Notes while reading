It assumes that we know what is right. And that we are acting as we think is right. And living up to the potential we believe we have.

    Its not as though you are correct or wrong. A person who is crazy and a person who has this divine vision for the future are on the same spectrum with their thoughts. If you consider a successful vision and frame of mind as Steve Job's producing the vision for the future of technology, it is not that Elon Musks is less that on that scale, or Steve Balmers. They are all lines pointed in different directions. There is almost a 3d sphere of potential thought directions that have infinite lines jutting out from a central point. No one has a right concept. Everyone has a dillusion. Some dillusions create something fitting for everyone else's delusion.
